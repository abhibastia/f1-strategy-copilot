"""
F1 Strategy Copilot — frontend.

A Databricks App that presents the project's central finding and lets a user
explore the corpus the agent reasons over: race results from the Spark pipeline,
measured race-day weather, and the narrative of race reports.

READ-ONLY BY DESIGN
-------------------
Nothing here writes. Every write in this project goes through the agent's MCP
tools, which is what makes the "agent takes real actions" requirement
demonstrable: the watchlist, predictions and notes on this page were all created
by the agent, not by a form on this page.

Serves entirely from Lakebase, so rendering a page costs no Databricks compute.

Run locally:
    python app.py
