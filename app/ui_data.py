"""
Queries backing the frontend.

Read-only. Every write in this project goes through the agent's MCP tools -
that is the point of the write tools, and a UI that also wrote directly would
make it impossible to demonstrate that the agent, specifically, took an action.
The watchlist, predictions and notes shown here were all written by the agent.

Like the MCP server, everything here reads Lakebase and nothing reads Delta, so
rendering a page costs no Databricks compute.
