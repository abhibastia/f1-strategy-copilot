"""
The race spine: season, round, date, circuit coordinates, Wikipedia URL.

Read from the medallion project's local landing files rather than from Delta.
That is deliberate and is the single most important cost decision in this build:
Databricks Free Edition has a daily compute quota that cannot be recovered until
the next day, and every Gold query spends it. The landing files hold exactly the
same `races` payloads the pipeline parsed, so reading them locally is free and
gives an identical spine.

The spine is what makes the whole project one system rather than two. Every
downstream row - race report chunk, weather observation, prediction, note -
carries the same (season, round) key the Gold marts use, so the agent can pivot
from a semantic hit in a race report straight into the results table for that
race.
