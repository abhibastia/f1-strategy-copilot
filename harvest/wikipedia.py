Wikipedia race reports — the unstructured-data source.

Every Grand Prix has an article whose "Report" section is genuine narrative
prose: how the race unfolded, incidents, strategy, controversy. That is the text
worth embedding. Results tables are not - the structured pipeline already models
those far better than free text ever could.

WHY THIS SOURCE
---------------
`f1.silver.dim_race` already carries `wikipedia_url` for all 71 races, so the
corpus is pre-addressed by the pipeline: no search, no title construction, no
disambiguation between "2024 Brazilian Grand Prix" and "Brazilian Grand Prix".
The URL is a fact from the data source, not a guess.

The MediaWiki API is free, needs no key, and returns plain text directly with
`prop=extracts&explaintext`, so there is no HTML to strip.
