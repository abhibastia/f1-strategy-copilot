"""Databricks task: chunk and embed race-report sections into Lakebase pgvector.

This was assumed impossible on Free Edition serverless, on the basis of a
day-2 notebook that was memory-killed loading sentence-transformers. That
conclusion was never retested for this model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is roughly 90 MB
and loads fine. Probed before wiring it up, and the probe succeeded.

Incremental by default - only documents with no embeddings are processed - so a
re-run after new race reports is cheap.
