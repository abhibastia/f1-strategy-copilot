"""
Data access for the F1 MCP server — every query and every write lives here.

The tools in `f1_mcp_server.py` stay thin: validate arguments, call one function
here, shape the result. Nothing in this module knows MCP exists, which is what
makes the F1 logic testable with a plain Python call — no agent, no MCP client,
no deployed app.

EVERYTHING READS POSTGRES, NOTHING READS DELTA
----------------------------------------------
The Spark pipeline's Gold marts were seeded into Lakebase once (see
`f1lake/seed_gold.py`). Serving them from Postgres means an agent turn costs no
Databricks compute — which matters because Free Edition's daily quota is
unrecoverable until the next day, and an agent that spends compute per question
is an agent that dies mid-demo.

IDENTITY RESOLUTION IS RETURNED, NEVER ASSUMED
-----------------------------------------------
Users say "Verstappen"; the data says `driver_id='max_verstappen'`. Every read
that resolves a name returns what it matched, so a wrong match is visible in the
agent's answer rather than silently wrong. That is the `resolved_location`
lesson from the weather MCP server, applied to drivers and races.
