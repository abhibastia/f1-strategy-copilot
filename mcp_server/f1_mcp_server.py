"""
F1 Strategy Copilot — MCP server.

Exposes F1 tools over MCP so a Databricks agent can call them:

  READ                              WRITE
  - get_driver_season               - add_to_watchlist
  - compare_constructors            - log_prediction
  - get_championship_standings      - save_race_note
  - get_race_weather
  - find_wet_races
  - search_race_reports
  - get_race_strategy · find_strategy_races
  - get_watchlist / get_predictions / get_race_notes

Every tool is thin: validate, call one `f1_broker` function, shape the result.
All SQL and all embedding live in the broker, so the F1 logic is testable with a
plain Python call - no agent, no MCP client, no deployed app.

THREE DATA SOURCES, ONE KEY
---------------------------
Jolpica-F1 (results, standings, via the Spark medallion pipeline), Wikipedia
(race-report prose, embedded for semantic search), and Open-Meteo's archive
(measured race-day weather). All three carry (season, round), so a semantic hit
in a race report pivots straight into that race's results and its rainfall.

Deploy as a Databricks App. Run locally:
