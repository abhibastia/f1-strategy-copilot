"""
Lakebase connection helper and the authoritative schema.

Lakebase is Databricks-managed Postgres. It is the OPERATIONAL half of this
project: the agent reads from it and, crucially, writes to it. The medallion
Gold marts in Delta remain the analytical half. Two stores, one shared key -
every table here carries (season, round), the same key `f1.silver.dim_race`
uses, so a semantic hit in a race report pivots straight into that race's
results.

WHY THE DDL LIVES HERE
----------------------
`databricks psql` connects as the workspace identity, while this code and the
deployed apps connect as the native Postgres role inside the secret URL.
Postgres grants table ownership to whoever ran CREATE TABLE. Tables created via
psql would be readable by the app but never alterable or indexable by it, which
surfaces much later as a 42501 on CREATE INDEX. Creating them here means the
role that reads and writes also owns.
